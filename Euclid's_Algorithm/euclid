EUCLID'S ALGORITHM:
          GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors.

STEPS:

  Step 1 If n = 0, return m and stop; otherwise go to Step 2

  Step 2 Divide m by n and assign the value of the remainder to r

  Step 3 Assign the value of n to m and the value of r to n. Go to Step 1.
  
  ALGORITHM:
      
  function gcd(a, b) {
  if (b == 0)
    return a;
  else
    return gcd(b, (a % b));
}

EXAMPLE:

      gcd(60,24) = gcd(24,12) = gcd(12,0) = 12
